        Welcome to <strong>Shelf Help</strong>, where we believe your pantry deserves better than that sad half-eaten sleeve of crackers and the mystery spice jar labeled "???" in your handwriting.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ever stood in front of your shelves, whispering, <em>"What do I even own?"</em> Congratulations! You’re one of us. Shelf Help is here to keep your pantry in check, your groceries on point, and your meals... well, at least <strong>not accidental science experiments.</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        Think of this as your <strong>pantry’s personal assistant</strong>—but instead of rolling its eyes at you when you ask if you already have pasta (you do, 7 boxes), it gently organizes your chaos into something almost resembling competence.
      </p>
